# Instagram clone

Applications for social media have had a significant influence on people's lives. I vividly recall texting my loved ones through SMS and waiting for a response. Most of the multimedia messages I send appear to be crap in terms of quality. My favourite social media platform was Instagram, and I still recall the period when I could only share photos with my friends. However, now most businesses run on Instagram. Therefore, I tried to recreate Instagram for Android. This application was natively developed using java on Android studio. This application allows users to create an account using their email id and, to make things even easier, they can sign in using Google. The application leverages Google's Firebase as a backend to authenticate users, chat, store, and retrieve user's data. The home fragment of the application shows all the posts of the following users, where you can like, save and comment on posts. One can look up users and follow or unfollow them from the search fragment. The notification fragment displays a list of users who liked or commented on your posts. The profile fragment displays all the userâ€™s information such as user name, Bio, following/followers count, and list of uploaded and saved posts. The app also allows users to chat with other users and I'm working on adding a calling feature so that users can voice call other users.
