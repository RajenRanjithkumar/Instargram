Applications for social media have had a significant influence on people's lives. I vividly recall texting my loved ones through SMS and waiting for a response. Most of the multimedia messages I send appear to be crap in terms of quality. My favourite social media platform was Instagram, and I still recall the period when I could only share photos with my friends. However, now most businesses run on Instagram. Therefore, I tried to recreate Instagram for Android. This application was natively developed using java on Android studio. This application allows users to create an account using their email id and, to make things even easier, they can sign in using Google. The application leverages Google's Firebase as a backend to authenticate users, chat, store, and retrieve users data.
